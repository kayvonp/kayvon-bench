**1. Introduction & Objectives of Workload Benchmark**  
Emily opened the meeting by outlining the purpose of the workload benchmark, which is to ensure optimal performance across our platforms as we prepare for the upcoming product launch. She emphasized the importance of accurately measuring response times, throughput, and system resilience under varying loads.  

**2. Review of Current Workload Metrics**  
Henry presented the current workload metrics, highlighting that our average response time stands at 200 ms, with peak usage hours showing load spikes that reach 120% of the system's capacity. He mentioned our recent deployments have improved stability but identified latency issues during high user engagement periods. Feedback from QA suggests that response times exceed acceptable thresholds, which could impact user experience and retention.

**3. Proposed Benchmarking Methodology**  
James proposed a comprehensive benchmarking strategy that includes both synthetic and real user simulations. The synthetic approach would allow the team to stress-test various scenarios, while the real user monitoring would provide insights into typical user experiences. He outlined the primary scenarios to be tested:
  - High-concurrency user sessions
  - API response times under load
  - Database transaction performance  
Consensus was achieved that both synthetic and real-user methodologies would provide the necessary insights for improvement.

**4. Discussion of Resources Needed**
